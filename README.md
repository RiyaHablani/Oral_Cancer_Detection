# Machine Learning for Early Oral Cancer Prediction

## Introduction

In contemporary healthcare, early detection of oral cancer is critical for improving patient outcomes and treatment efficacy. This project leverages machine learning methodologies to predict oral cancer at its early stages using medical images.

## Rationale

Early detection enables timely medical interventions, significantly enhancing the chances of successful treatment and recovery. By employing advanced computational techniques, this project aims to develop a predictive model capable of analyzing medical images to identify potential cases of oral cancer.

## Objectives

* Develop and fine-tune machine learning models specifically for early detection of oral cancer.
* Utilize comprehensive datasets containing oral cancer images data for model training and validation.
* Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
* Lay the groundwork for integrating predictive models into clinical practice, enhancing diagnostic capabilities in oral cancer detection.
